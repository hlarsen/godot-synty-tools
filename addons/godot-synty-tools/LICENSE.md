**Friendly Note for Commercial Use**

While the MIT license allows commercial use, if your commercial project benefits
from this software, please consider making a donation to support its development.
Even a few Synty packs (that would be added to this addon!) would be greatly
appreciated. My three cats and dog would think you're the coolest.
Thank you!
